## **Purpose**

This repo contains the data, full source code, final report, and slides for my MAT 8790 final project.  The objective of this project is to compare *k*-means cluster results for quality of life characteristics across countries, with particular focus on comparing clustering results for the United States to other nations having a similar level of development. 

## **Contents**

The repo is organized as follows:
