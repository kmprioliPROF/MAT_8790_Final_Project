<!-- Notes
  * Do a sensitivity analysis on cluster number (shiny?)
  * Clustering:  in Shiny app, write code to display "The United States is in " _fill in the blank_ "cluster"
  * Need to better organize flow of report (some results are in Methods, etc)
  * Need to more fully narrate steps and interpretations of output
  * Ensure uniform ordering of table contents, output, references
  
  * Limitations:

## **Background**

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recently issued a report indicating that life expectancy in the United States has decreased in 2017 as compared to 2016, with the overwhelming majority of deaths caused by heart disease and cancer, arguably preventable illnesses (@cdc_lifeexp).  Given that the United States has the world's largest economy, this decline in life expectancy is particularly concerning, and indicates that national wealth may not be predictive of citizens' longevity (@worldbank_gdp). 

As the world's economies trend toward globalism, there is increasing interest in understanding how these nations compare on key quality of life (QoL) factors, including but not limted to life expectancy.  Several organizations report on QoL measures as they evolve, including among others the World Economic Forum (WEF), World Health Organization (WHO), and the United Nations Development Programme.  The QoL measures reported by these bodies can be either unidimensional values or compound scores calculated from several factors of interest.

The objective of this analysis is to explore key QoL indicators by country, with particular focus on how the United States ranks, through a series of visualizations and *k*-means clustering analyses.


## **Methods**

This analysis included country-level QoL indicators as described in Table 1.

**Table 1.  Country-Level QoL measures.**

```{r table_1, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)

meas <- c("Gross Domestic Product (GDP)", "Infant mortality rate", "Life expectancy at birth", 
          "Life expectancy at sixty", "Human Development Index (HDI)", "Human Development Index (HDI)", 
          "Social Progress Index", "Global Gender Gap Index", "World Happiness Score")
sing_comp <- c(rep("Single", 4), rep("Compound", 5))
measdesc <- c("Valued in $US 2018", 
              "Number of infant deaths per 1,000 live births", 
              "Expected life at birth, both genders", 
              "Expected remaining life years at age 60, both genders", 
              "Developmental level, scale of 0:1", 
              "Developmental category, four levels (low, medium, high, very high)", 
              "Social progress level, scaled from 0:100 and comprising three broad categories:  basic human needs (e.g., nutrition, safety), foundations of wellbeing (e.g., basic knowledge, environmental quality), and opportunity (e.g., personal rights, freedoms)", 
              "Gender equality index, scaled from 0:1, based on measurements of gender-related gaps in such dimensions as economic participation, level of education, health and survival, and political offices held", 
              "Happiness score, scaled from 0:10, based on several factors including per-capita GDP, healthy life expectancy, social support, freedoms, and perception of corruption")
measref <- c("@worldbank_gdp", "@who_infantmort", "@who_life", "@who_life", "@un_dvlpt_HDIdesc", 
              "@un_dvlpt_HDIdesc", "@socialprog_desc", "@wef_gender_desc", "@whr")

table_1 <- as.tibble(cbind(meas, sing_comp, measdesc, measref))
colnames(table_1) <- c("Measure", "Single or Compound", "Description", "Source")
table_1_kbl <- table_1 %>% 
  kable(format = "latex") %>% 
  column_spec(1, width = "10em", border_left = FALSE, border_right = FALSE) %>% 
  column_spec(2, width = "6em", border_left = FALSE, border_right = FALSE) %>% 
  column_spec(3, width = "25em", border_left = FALSE, border_right = FALSE) %>% 
  column_spec(4, width = "8em", border_left = FALSE, border_right = FALSE)
table_1_kbl
```


Data for these measures was obtained for calendar year 2016 in `.csv` or `.xls(x)` formats.  Additionally, dataframe containing country identifiers (full names and three-letter codes) was generated from the `countrycode` library to facilitate merging the datafiles into one dataframe.

### *Wrangling and Exploration*

Each country-level datafile was imported, wrangled as needed, then tested against the dataframe containing country identifiers via `anti_join()` to identify mismatches.  Mismatching country names were manually recoded for each datafile, then all datafiles were merged using serial `lef_join()` statements.  Countries with wholly missing data were excluded.  The resulting dataframe, titled `alldata`, is presented in Table 2.

**Table 2.  `alldata` dataframe contents.**

| @who_life        	              | sixty_MF             	| Life expectancy at 60 years, males & females     	|

At least one univariate visualization was generated for each variable in `alldata` via `ggplot()`, and a correlation matrix was produced to investigate pairwise relationshps between continuous variables.  Next, a series of ordered country-as-factor bivariate visualizations were created to explore the top and bottom 20 countries by ranking within each variable.

### *k-Means Clustering*

To assess how the United States compares to the rest of the world, a series of *k*-means cluster analyses was carried out.  *K*-means clustering is described elsewhere; briefly, given bivariate data and a desired number *k* groups, this classification algorithm classifies the points in the two-dimensional plane to minimize the total within-cluster variation for all clusters (@intro_stat_learn).  This is an iterative process that works by establishing *k* centroids, classifying each point by which centroid is closest, then moving the centroids to the center of their corrresponding clusters, and repeating the process.  Iteration terminates when the centroids no longer move, and the classification established in this terminal iteraton is the clustering.

The Human Development Index categorizes the world's countries into four developmental levels (low, medium, high, and very high); thus *k*-means clustering analysis was performed assuming 4 clusters.  Missing values were excluded to ensure the clustering algorithm would run, and a function was written to subset the clustering dataset (named `clusterdata`) to the variables of interest for each *k*-means analysis.  On each output plot, the United States was identified by an enlarged `geom_point()`.

For brevity, example code for wrangling, plotting, and clustering is presented in the Results section; full code is available in the GitHub repository for this report (@kmpgit).  The libraries required for this analysis were loaded as shown below.

```{r setup, include = TRUE, warning = FALSE, results = 'hide', echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)          # For importing .xls(x) datasets
library(lazyeval)        # For renaming columns in function
library(countrycode)     # For establishing uniform country identifiers
library(ggthemr)         # For prettifying output
library(gridExtra)       # For grid.arrange()
library(grid)            # For textGrob() to annotate grid.arrange() elements
library(kableExtra)      # For nicer output tables
library(GGally)          # For ggpairs() correlation matrix

ggthemr("fresh")
```


### *Example code*

Establishing a crosswalk for country names and 3-letter codes:

```{r countries, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
countries_full <- codelist_panel %>% 
  select(country.name.en, year, genc3c, iso3c, wb_api3c) %>% 
  group_by(country.name.en) %>% 
  mutate(maxyr = max(year)) %>% 
  ungroup %>% 
  mutate(maxyr = case_when(
    maxyr == year ~ 1,
    TRUE ~ 0
  )) %>% 
  filter(maxyr == 1) %>% 
  select(-maxyr) %>% 
  distinct()

countries_full <- countries_full %>% 
  mutate(country3 = case_when(
    iso3c == genc3c & iso3c == wb_api3c ~ iso3c,
    is.na(iso3c) == FALSE ~ iso3c,
    is.na(iso3c) == TRUE & is.na(genc3c) == FALSE ~ genc3c,
    is.na(iso3c) == TRUE & is.na(genc3c) == TRUE & is.na(wb_api3c) == FALSE ~ wb_api3c
  )) %>% 
  rename(country = country.name.en) %>% 
  arrange(country)
  
countries <- countries_full %>% 
  select(country, country3)
```

Importing and wrangling each data file, and standardizing country names:

```{r HDI_import, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Importing raw data

HDIraw <- read_xlsx("data/HDIdata2018.xlsx", sheet = "Table 2")

# Selecting columns of interest

HDIdata <- HDIraw %>%
  select(1:2, X__14)

# Assigning sensible column names

HDIcolnm <- c(HDIdata[[3,1]], HDIdata[[3,2]], HDIdata[[4,3]])
colnames(HDIdata) <- HDIcolnm

# Determining boundaries for human development levels in the data
# and using these to create one dataframe for each level

vhhd_st <- which(HDIdata$Country == "VERY HIGH HUMAN DEVELOPMENT") + 1
vhhd_end <- which(HDIdata$Country == "HIGH HUMAN DEVELOPMENT") - 1

hhd_st <- which(HDIdata$Country == "HIGH HUMAN DEVELOPMENT") + 1
hhd_end <- which(HDIdata$Country == "MEDIUM HUMAN DEVELOPMENT") - 1

mhd_st <- which(HDIdata$Country == "MEDIUM HUMAN DEVELOPMENT") + 1
mhd_end <- which(HDIdata$Country == "LOW HUMAN DEVELOPMENT") - 1

lhd_st <- which(HDIdata$Country == "LOW HUMAN DEVELOPMENT") + 1
lhd_end <- which(HDIdata$Country == "OTHER COUNTRIES OR TERRITORIES") - 1

oth_st <- which(HDIdata$Country == "OTHER COUNTRIES OR TERRITORIES") + 1
oth_end <- which(HDIdata$Country == "Human development groups") - 2

HDI_vhhd <- HDIdata %>% 
  slice(vhhd_st:vhhd_end) %>% 
  mutate(HDI_cat = "Very High")

HDI_hhd <- HDIdata %>% 
  slice(hhd_st:hhd_end) %>% 
  mutate(HDI_cat = "High")

HDI_mhd <- HDIdata %>% 
  slice(mhd_st:mhd_end) %>% 
  mutate(HDI_cat = "Medium")

HDI_lhd <- HDIdata %>% 
  slice(lhd_st:lhd_end) %>% 
  mutate(HDI_cat = "Low")

HDI_oth <- HDIdata %>% 
  slice(oth_st:oth_end) %>% 
  mutate(HDI_cat = NA)

# Combining the dataframes into one 

HDIdata <- bind_rows(HDI_vhhd, HDI_hhd, HDI_mhd, HDI_lhd, HDI_oth) %>% 
  rename(HDIrank = `HDI rank`) %>% 
  rename(country = Country) %>% 
  rename(HDIindex = `2016`) %>% 
  mutate(HDI_cat = factor(HDI_cat, levels = c("Low", "Medium", "High", "Very High"))) %>% 
  mutate(HDIrank = case_when(
    HDIrank == ".." ~ as.numeric(NA),
    TRUE ~ as.numeric(HDIrank)
  )) %>% 
  mutate(HDIindex = case_when(
    HDIindex == ".." ~ as.numeric(NA),
    TRUE ~ as.numeric(HDIindex)
  ))
HDIdata <- HDIdata[c(2, 1, 3:4)]
```

Standardizing country names by using `anti_join()` to see which countries in `HDIdata` don't have a match in the `countries` dataframe, and correcting those for which an inexact match exists:

```{r HDI_countrytest, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
HDIanti <- HDIdata %>%
  anti_join(countries, by = "country") %>%
  select(country) %>%
  arrange(country)
dim(HDIanti)
```

Correcting for mismatches with `countries` using `mutate()`:

```{r HDI_countryfix, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}

HDIdata <- HDIdata %>%
  mutate(country = case_when(
    country == "Antigua and Barbuda"                       ~ "Antigua & Barbuda",
    country == "Bolivia (Plurinational State of)"          ~ "Bolivia",

## **Results**

### *Data Exploration and Visualizations*

First, exploring the Social Progress Index data:

```{r SPIplot, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
SPI_hist
```

Next, exploring GDP by summary statistics:

```{r GDPsumm, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
GDPsumm <- broom::tidy(round(summary(alldata$GDP_USD_2018 / 1000000), digits = 4)) %>% 
  kable(format = "markdown")
GDPsumm
```

Taking the log transform and plotting:

```{r GDPplot, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
GDP_hist <- ggplot(data = alldata, aes(x = log(GDP_USD_2018))) +
  geom_histogram(bins = ceiling(sqrt(len - sum(is.na(alldata$GDP_USD_2018))))) +
  xlab("log(GDP) ($US 2018)") +
  ylab("Count") +
  ggtitle("Gross Domestic Product Distribution, Log Transform") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format(prefix = "$"))
GDP_hist
```

Exploring the Human Development Index variables:

```{r HDIplots, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 4}
HDIindex_hist <- ggplot(data = alldata, aes(x = HDIindex)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = ceiling(sqrt(len - sum(is.na(alldata$HDIindex))))) +
  xlab("Human Development Index") +
  ylab("Count") +
  ggtitle("Human Development Index Distribution")

HDIcat_bar <- ggplot(data = alldata, aes(x = HDI_cat)) +
  geom_bar() +
  geom_text(stat = "count", aes(label = ..count..), color = "#233b43",
            hjust = 0.5, position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
  xlab("Human Development Category") +
  ylab("Count") +
  ggtitle("Human Development Index Counts \nby Category")

grid.arrange(HDIindex_hist, HDIcat_bar, nrow = 1)
```

Exploring the World Happiness Report data:

```{r happinessplot, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
happiness_hist <- ggplot(data = alldata, aes(happiness)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = ceiling(sqrt(len - sum(is.na(alldata$happiness))))) +
  xlab("Happiness Score") +
  ylab("Count") +
  ggtitle("Happiness Score Distribution")
happiness_hist
```

Exploring the gender equality index data:

```{r genderplot, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
gender_hist <- ggplot(data = alldata, aes(x = genderequality_index)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = ceiling(sqrt(len - sum(is.na(alldata$genderequality_index))))) +
  xlab("Gender Equality Index") +
  ylab("Count") +
  ggtitle("Gender Equality Index Distribution")
gender_hist
```

Exploring the WHO infant mortality rate data:

```{r infantmortplot, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
infantmort_hist <- ggplot(data = alldata, aes(x = infantmort)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = ceiling(sqrt(len - sum(is.na(alldata$genderequality_index))))) +
  xlab("Probability of Infant Mortality") +
  ylab("Count") +
  ggtitle("Infant Mortality Distribution")

Exploring the WHO life expectancy data:

```{r lifeexpplot, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 4}
lifeexp_birth_box <- ggplot(data = alldata, aes(y = birth_MF)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ylim(50, 100) +
  ylab("Total Life Expectancy (years)") +
  ggtitle("...at Birth") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank())

lifeexp_sixty_box <- ggplot(data = alldata, aes(y = 60 + sixty_MF)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ylim(50, 100) +
  ylab("") +
  ggtitle("...at Age 60") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.line.y.left = element_blank())

grid.arrange(lifeexp_birth_box, lifeexp_sixty_box, nrow = 1,
             top = textGrob("Total Life Expectancy...",
                            gp = gpar(fontsize = 16, fontface = "bold", col = "#545454")))
```

Investigating pairwise relationships between continuous variables:

```{r calc_corrplot, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8}
alldata <- alldata %>% mutate(logGDP = log(GDP_USD_2018))

corrplot <- ggpairs(data = alldata, columns = c(5, 15, 8, 10:14),
                    title = "Correlation Matrix, Continuous Variables")
corrplot
```

Strong positive linear relationships are seen between `HDIindex` and `SPI`, `happiness`, and `birth_MF`; between `SPI` and `happiness`, `birth_MF`, and `sixty_MF`; and between `happiness` and `sixty_MF`.  Additionally, strong positive relationships that are possibly nonlinear are seen between `HDI_index` and `sixty_MF`, and between `birth_MF` and `sixty_MF`.

Strong negative relationships are seen between `infantmort` and `birth_MF`, between `HDIindex` and `infantmort`, and between `SPI` and `infantmort`, though the latter two of these may not necessarily be linear.  A strong negative nonlinear relationship is seen between `infantmort` and `sixty_MF`.

Since the goal of this analysis is to compare countries with particular focus on the United States, factor-ordered bivariate plots were generated to explore how the countries compare across the variables of interest, with the United States denoted in red.

First, the top and bottom 20 countries were compared by Social Progress Index:

```{r SPI_country_out, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
SPI_country_point
```

The United States ranks twentieth in social progress.

Next, exploring GDP by country:

```{r GDP_country, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 9}
alldata_GDP <- alldata %>%
  filter(!is.na(GDP_USD_2018) == TRUE) %>% 
  arrange(desc(GDP_USD_2018)) %>% 
  select(GDP_USD_2018, country, US, color)

alldata_GDP_top20 <- alldata_GDP %>% head(20)
alldata_GDP_bot20 <- alldata_GDP %>% tail(20)
alldata_GDP_40 <- bind_rows(alldata_GDP_top20, alldata_GDP_bot20)

colors <- alldata_GDP_40$color[order(alldata_GDP_40$GDP_USD_2018)]

GDP_country_point <- ggplot(data = alldata_GDP_40, 
                            aes(x = log(GDP_USD_2018), 
                                y = fct_reorder(country, GDP_USD_2018), 
                                color = US)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format(prefix = "$")) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("US" = "red", "Non US" = "#65ADC2")) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(color = colors)) +
  guides(color = FALSE) +
  xlab("log(Gross Domestic Product) ($US 2018)") +
  ylab("Country") +
  ggtitle("Gross Domestic Product by Country, Log Scale, \nTop and Bottom 20 Countries")
GDP_country_point
```

The United States has the world's largest GDP.
 
Next, World Happiness Score:

```{r WHR_country, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
alldata_WHR <- alldata %>%
  filter(!is.na(happiness) == TRUE) %>% 
  arrange(desc(happiness)) %>% 
  select(happiness, country, US, color)

alldata_WHR_top20 <- alldata_WHR %>% head(20)
alldata_WHR_bot20 <- alldata_WHR %>% tail(20)
alldata_WHR_40 <- bind_rows(alldata_WHR_top20, alldata_WHR_bot20)

colors <- alldata_WHR_40$color[order(alldata_WHR_40$happiness)]

WHR_country_point <- ggplot(data = alldata_WHR_40, 
                            aes(x = happiness, y = fct_reorder(country, happiness), color = US)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("US" = "red", "Non US" = "#65ADC2")) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(color = colors)) +
  guides(color = FALSE) +
  xlim(0, 10) +
  xlab("World Happiness Score") +
  ylab("Country") +
  ggtitle("World Happiness Score by Country, \nTop and Bottom 20 Countries")
WHR_country_point
```

```{r WHR_rank, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
which(alldata_WHR$country == "United States")
```

The United States is not among the top 20 countries in terms of happiness; it ranks 21st.

Next, the Human Development Index:

```{r HDI_country, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
alldata_HDI <- alldata %>%
  filter(!is.na(HDIindex) == TRUE) %>% 
  arrange(desc(HDIindex)) %>% 
  select(HDIindex, country, US, color)

alldata_HDI_top20 <- alldata_HDI %>% head(20)
alldata_HDI_bot20 <- alldata_HDI %>% tail(20)
alldata_HDI40 <- bind_rows(alldata_HDI_top20, alldata_HDI_bot20)

colors <- alldata_HDI40$color[order(alldata_HDI40$HDIindex)]

HDI_country_point <- ggplot(data = alldata_HDI40, 
                            aes(x = HDIindex, y = fct_reorder(country, HDIindex), color = US)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("US" = "red", "Non US" = "#65ADC2")) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(color = colors)) +
  guides(color = FALSE) +
  xlim(0, 1) +
  xlab("HDI") +
  ylab("Country") +
  ggtitle("Human Development Index by Country, \nTop and Bottom 20 Countries")
HDI_country_point
```

The United States ranks twelfth by HDI.

Exploring gender equality:

```{r gender_country, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
alldata_gender <- alldata %>%
  filter(!is.na(genderequality_index) == TRUE) %>% 
  arrange(desc(genderequality_index)) %>% 
  select(genderequality_index, country, US, color)

alldata_gender_top20 <- alldata_gender %>% head(20)
alldata_gender_bot20 <- alldata_gender %>% tail(20)
alldata_gender_40 <- bind_rows(alldata_gender_top20, alldata_gender_bot20)

colors <- alldata_gender_40$color[order(alldata_gender_40$genderequality_index)]

gender_country_point <- ggplot(data = alldata_gender_40, 
                            aes(x = genderequality_index, 
                                y = fct_reorder(country, genderequality_index), 
                                color = US)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("US" = "red", "Non US" = "#65ADC2")) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(color = colors)) +
  guides(color = FALSE) +
  xlim(0, 1) +
  xlab("Gender Equality Index") +
  ylab("Country") +
  ggtitle("Gender Equality Index by Country, \nTop and Bottom 20 Countries")
gender_country_point
```

```{r gender_rank, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
which(alldata_gender$country == "United States")
```

The United States is not among the top 20 countries in terms of gender equality; it ranks 45th.

Examining infant mortality:

```{r infantmort_country, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
alldata_infantmort <- alldata %>%
  filter(!is.na(infantmort) == TRUE) %>% 
  arrange(desc(infantmort)) %>% 
  select(infantmort, country, US, color)

alldata_infantmort_top20 <- alldata_infantmort %>% head(20)
alldata_infantmort_bot20 <- alldata_infantmort %>% tail(20)
alldata_infantmort_40 <- bind_rows(alldata_infantmort_top20, alldata_infantmort_bot20)

colors <- alldata_infantmort_40$color[order(alldata_infantmort_40$infantmort)]

infantmort_country_point <- ggplot(data = alldata_infantmort_40, 
                                   aes(x = infantmort, 
                                       y = fct_reorder(country, infantmort), 
                                       color = US)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("US" = "red", "Non US" = "#65ADC2")) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(color = colors)) +
  guides(color = FALSE) +
  xlab("Infant Mortality Rate") +
  ylab("Country") +
  ggtitle("Infant Mortality Rate, \nTop and Bottom 20 Countries")
infantmort_country_point
```

```{r infantmort_rank, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
alldata_infantmort_asc <- alldata_infantmort %>% arrange(infantmort)
which(alldata_infantmort_asc$country == "United States")
```

The United States has the world's 46th lowest infant mortality rate.

Finally, exploring life expectancy:

```{r lifeexp_country, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 12}
alldata_lifeexp <- alldata %>%
  filter(!is.na(birth_MF) == TRUE & !is.na(sixty_MF) == TRUE)

alldata_lifeexp_birth <- alldata_lifeexp %>% 
  arrange(desc(birth_MF)) %>% 
  select(birth_MF, country, US, color)

alldata_lifeexp_birth_top20 <- alldata_lifeexp_birth %>% head(20)
alldata_lifeexp_birth_bot20 <- alldata_lifeexp_birth %>% tail(20)
alldata_lifeexp_birth_40 <- bind_rows(alldata_lifeexp_birth_top20, alldata_lifeexp_birth_bot20)

colors <- alldata_lifeexp_birth_40$color[order(alldata_lifeexp_birth_40$birth_MF)]

birth_MF_country_point <- ggplot(data = alldata_lifeexp_birth_40, 
                            aes(x = birth_MF, 
                                y = fct_reorder(country, birth_MF), 
                                color = US)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("US" = "red", "Non US" = "#65ADC2")) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(color = colors)) +
  guides(color = FALSE) +
  xlim(0, 100) +
  xlab("Total Life Expectancy (years)") +
  ylab("Country") +
  ggtitle("...At Birth")

alldata_lifeexp_sixty <- alldata_lifeexp %>% 
  arrange(desc(sixty_MF)) %>% 
  select(sixty_MF, country, US, color)

alldata_lifeexp_sixty_top20 <- alldata_lifeexp_sixty %>% head(20)
alldata_lifeexp_sixty_bot20 <- alldata_lifeexp_sixty %>% tail(20)
alldata_lifeexp_sixty_40 <- bind_rows(alldata_lifeexp_sixty_top20, alldata_lifeexp_sixty_bot20)

colors <- alldata_lifeexp_sixty_40$color[order(alldata_lifeexp_sixty_40$sixty_MF)]

sixty_MF_country_point <- ggplot(data = alldata_lifeexp_sixty_40, 
                            aes(x = 60 + sixty_MF, 
                                y = fct_reorder(country, sixty_MF), 
                                color = US)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("US" = "red", "Non US" = "#65ADC2")) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(color = colors)) +
  guides(color = FALSE) +
  xlim(0, 100) +
  xlab("Total Life Expectancy (years)") +
  ylab("Country") +
  ggtitle("...At Age 60")

grid.arrange(birth_MF_country_point, sixty_MF_country_point, nrow = 1,
             top = textGrob("Total Life Expectancy by Country...",
                            gp = gpar(fontsize = 16, fontface = "bold", col = "#545454")))
```

```{r lifeexp_ranks, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
which(alldata_lifeexp_birth$country == "United States")
which(alldata_lifeexp_sixty$country == "United States")
```

Once again, the United States is not among the top 20 countries for life expectancy, ranking 34th and 31st respectively for life expectancy at birth and at 60 years of age.


### **Clustering Analysis**

```{r NAomit, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
clusterdata <- alldata %>%
  na.omit()

# write_csv(clusterdata, paste0("data/clusterdata_", lubridate::today(),".csv"))  # Uncomment to export clustering dataset
```

```{r kmeans_fxn, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
